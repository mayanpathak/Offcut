# v4changelog.md - record of every change made while building V4

**What this is.** A record of every change made while building V4: what was done, what differs from the plan, the guide or the prompts, how it was checked, and what is still open. It is opened early, before V4's implementation plan, build guide and prompts exist, because the v1.2 spec revision of 2026-10-21 changes what V4 builds. When V4's build step S1 runs, it keeps Entry 0 and adds its baseline as Entry 1.

**How it is kept.** One entry per prompt, or per change made outside a prompt. Entries are in date order, oldest first; new entries go at the end. Every commit that changes the repository carries its entry. The two tables "Open items" and "Known issues" are rewritten when an item opens or closes.

**References.** `PS §n` is a section of `product.md`, `TS §n` of `technicalspec.md`, `BP §n` of `buildplan.md`, `V3 CL item n` an open item of `v3changelog.md`.

## Open items
| # | Item | Owner | Version |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Launch date.** V6.1-V6.7 now sit between V6 and V7 (BP §8A). The 21 Dec 2026 launch holds only if V6.x fits in the two weeks V1-V3 gained; the founder re-sets M2 and the launch when V6.7 closes (PS A-2, TS §39.3 item 32) | Founder | V6.7 |
| 2 | **AI provider (TE-15).** Free-tier limits, structured output, latency and data-use terms decide the provider and the plan quotas. If the only fitting free tier trains on inputs, the founder decides between a paid tier, disclosing it, or making the AI plan opt-in (PS §17, TS §37) | Founder + V6.1 | V6.1 |
| 3 | **Starting plan quotas** (anonymous 3/day, Free 30/month, Creator 300/month soft) and the default "AI edit plan: on" are (assumption) values chosen in this revision, not founder numbers; TE-15 replaces them (PS §11, TS §40.7) | Founder | V6.1 |
| 4 | **Brand kit is Creator-only** in exports (Free sees it in preview). Chosen in this revision from the founder's "this is what makes people stay subscribed"; confirm or change (PS §11, TS §40.10) | Founder | V6.7 |
| 5 | V3 CL item 7 (the Linux ffmpeg URL, before about 2026-11-27) carries over unchanged | Founder | V4 |
| 6 | **Open a draft pull request `v4-build` → `main`** (optional, so CI runs on every push, as in V3) | Founder | Any time |

## Known issues
| # | Issue | Where | Version |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `AudioWorkerApi` (TS §14.2) is described as frozen, and v1.2 adds `assemble` to it in V4 (TS §40.6, §40.9 S-6). V4's implementation plan must record the protocol change as a REOPENED contract, as V3 did for `FeedLine` | TS §14.2 | V4 |
| 2 | TS §19.2, §20.2 and §21.3 still show the v1.1 signatures (`events` in `SceneInput`, `crop()`, `render(frame, crop, rotation, list)`, `to_time_ms`). Each section now opens with a v1.2 note pointing to §40.5 / §40.9; V4's copy-back rewrites the signatures themselves when the code exists | TS §19-§21 | V4 |

## Entry 0 - 2026-10-21 - Spec revision v1.2: the AI edit plan (outside a prompt)

**Why.** The founder decided on 2026-10-21 that Offcut ships as an AI-planned, Submagic-class editor before launch: an LLM reads the transcript (text and timings only; video and voice stay local) and writes an edit and render plan that drives intelligent pause and silence trimming, background music with ducking, kinetic captions, video inside shapes, shape transitions, furniture (progress bar, chapter markers, hook title card, lower third, end card with CTA), the brand kit, the list builder, cards, number moments, emphasis picks, and text extras (hook title, chapter names, post caption, hashtags). The founder also asked that V4, V5 and V6 be written for this plan so that V6.1 meets no blockers. This entry records the specification change; no code changed.

**What changed.**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `docs/product.md` (v1.1 → v1.2) | Positioning rewritten; revision note v1.2; §0 note; A-2 (dates after V6.x); §1 pipeline and wedge; principles 2, 3, 4 and 7 rewritten (numbers are pointers; toggles and cut restores; media never leaves, transcript leaves only for the plan and can be switched off; cuts are plan suggestions the user can restore, never inside a word, nothing cut without a plan); §9.1 path; §9.2 rows (music, cloud LLM, B-roll, brand kit, timeline editing); §9.2.1 replaced by "What Offcut does to your recording"; §9.5 seven P0 rows V6.1-V6.7 and the V6.x scope rule; §9.6-§9.8; journey J6, J8, J11; §11 pricing rows and "the one real per-clip cost" (plan quotas); §12.1, §12.3-§12.7; new §12.8 "The AI edit plan"; §15 diagram; §16 data model (PlanUsage, EditPlan, MusicTrack, BrandKit); §17 analytics rule and edit-plan row; §18 two new risks; §19 E-11; §20.1 checklist (cuts, plan validation, music, brand kit, privacy); §21 items 3, 4, 10, 11 updated, item 14 (B-roll) added |
| `docs/technicalspec.md` (v1.1 → v1.2) | Status and precedence; timeline principles rewritten (`TIMELINE_INTEGRITY`); §0 "Changes in v1.2"; §1 overview, diagram (`/plan`, AI provider), backend limits; §2 rows (`server` may use `offcut-plan`; new `offcut-plan` row); §5 tree (`v4/v4changelog.md`, buildplan line); §10.1 `OutMs`, `to_out_ms`; §10.5, §10.6, §10.8 notes; §18 model note; §19, §20, §21 v1.2 notes, duration rule, render-cache key; §22.1 `POST /plan`; §24.1 AI provider host; §25.1 P-1, P-5 rewritten, P-14 added; §25.2 assertions 3, 4, 4b; §25.3 rows; §28 steps M1.9-M1.15; §35 INV-2, INV-5, INV-9, INV-10 rewritten, INV-21 to INV-24 added; §36 rows replaced; §37 TE-15, TE-16, E-11; §38 TDR-4 amended, TDR-7 replaced, TDR-18 to TDR-21 added; §39.1 rows; §39.3 items 29-33; **new §40 Edit Plan Architecture** (two timelines, plan types, capability catalog, validation rules V-1 to V-8, scene and renderer contracts, program audio, the `/plan` route, client flow, the seams S-1 to S-10 that V4-V6 build, the V6.x releases, what stays forbidden) |
| `docs/buildplan.md` (v1 → v1.2) | Header and v1.2 paragraph; §0 table rows V6.1-V6.7 and "Dates after v1.2"; §1.2 tags; §1.4 lines never crossed rewritten and extended; V4 §6.1 block A2 (seams S-1 to S-7) and exit items; V5 seams S-8, S-9; V6 goal (S-10, freeze moved to `v6.7`); **new §8A V6.1-V6.7** (order, reasons, build, demo, exit per release); V7 and V8 depend on V6.7; V7 E-2 notes feed E-11; V8 demo; V10 checklist (cuts, privacy) |
| `docs/v4/v4changelog.md` | Created with this entry |

**Decisions taken in this revision that the founder has not stated** (each is an open item above): the starting plan quotas, "AI edit plan" on by default, brand kit Creator-only in exports, V6.x release order V6.4 → V6.5 → V6.6 among the visual releases, filler-word cuts off by default, the cut limits (150 ms minimum pause, 40% maximum removed), and that the plan request sends the ASR transcript, not the user's word edits (P-1 keeps edits local; validation applies them).

**What V4 must now build that the v1.1 plan did not** (BP §6.1 A2, TS §40.9): `OutMs` and an identity `TimeMap`; the `offcut-plan` crate with the rules producer, validator, catalog and generated prompt; `QuantityRef`; `DrawCmd::Video` and `DrawCmd::Image` with the renderer drawing in list order; `FontKey`/`FontSet`, `Theme`, `StyleSpec.motion`, a zone table; `program::assemble` (identity) with the preview playing `prog48`; a review UI generic over plan items.

**How it was checked.** `node scripts/check-file-tree.mjs` (the new changelog is listed in TS §5). No code changed, so no test count changed.

**Open.** Items 1-5 above; known issues 1-2.

## Entry 0.1 - 2026-10-21 - `v4implementation.md` written (outside a prompt)

**What.** `docs/v4/v4implementation.md`, the file-by-file plan for V4, written against spec v1.2 and V3 as built, in the structure of `v3implementation.md`. It covers:
- BP §6 (M1.4, M1.5) together with the seams S-1 to S-7 of TS §40.9
- 54 decisions, D-113 to D-166
- a 17-step build order over ten working days: contracts first, then the identity proof (D-116, D-117), then the look, the workers, review, robustness, tests, CI, measurement and deploy
- the file-by-file hand-over to V5, V6 and V6.1-V6.7 (section 22.2)

TS §5 lists the new file.

**Decisions that refine the spec** (copied back at V4 S16, section 24):
- D-119: the plan's wire format is fixed at `PLAN_FORMAT = 1` in V4.
- D-120, D-121: rule-produced items carry the detector's own values (`ItemParams::Detected`), and number resolution happens in `validate`, not in `build_scene`.
- D-122: `offcut-plan` depends on `offcut-text`, and the scene depends on `offcut-plan`.
- D-130: `Video.dst` is an axis-aligned rectangle.
- D-136: `Theme` gains `mono_font`.
- Section 8.7: `ValidItem.marks` carries FromTo's second time.

**Decisions that reopen V1-V3 contracts:**
- D-125: `FrameIdx::to_time_ms` becomes `to_out_ms`.
- D-126: `ClockSync`, `previewSeek` and the `MINTING` entry move to `OutMs`.
- D-127, D-128: `AudioWorkerApi` gains `assemble` and `release`.
- D-130: `DrawCmd` gains `Video` and `Image`.
- D-132: `FontId` becomes `FontKey`.
- D-133: the `Renderer::render` signature changes.
- D-136: style colours become theme roles.

**Found while reading the code for the plan.** Four files have no room for V4's additions: `render.worker.ts` (372 lines), `rpc.ts` (377), `video-source.ts` (399) and `session.rs` (381). D-150 splits each before anything is added. V3 §23 items 24 and 25 are closed by D-150 and D-128.

**How it was checked.** `node scripts/check-file-tree.mjs` passes. Decision numbers run D-113 to D-166 with no gap and no duplicate. No code changed.

**Open.** Items 6 and 7 above (the founder's, before S1).

---

## Entry 0.2 - 2026-10-22 - One branch for V4: `v4-build` (outside a prompt)

**Decision.** The founder chose one branch for all of V4: "exactly like V3 we will have another branch for V4 and we will commit to that branch only" (option B).

**What was done.**
- The local branch `v4-spec` was renamed `v4-build`.
- `origin/main` (`550ff8f`, "Landing hero") was merged into it (`81474bf`). That brings in `docs/v3/v3changelog.md` and one line of `web/src/copy/messages.ts`; there were no conflicts.
- `v4-build` was pushed to `origin`.
- Spec v1.2 reaches `main` with V4's merge, not before.

**Changed in `v4implementation.md`.**
- 1A items 2 and 3 are ticked and rewritten: spec v1.2 is on `v4-build`, and the code baseline is `550ff8f`.
- D-115 is rewritten: one branch, the agent pushes every commit to `v4-build`, and `main`, the merge and the tag are the founder's.
- Section 3.3 is updated.

**Open items.** Item 6 (merge `v4-spec`) and item 7 (the push rule) are closed by this decision. A new item 6 asks for an optional draft pull request.

**How it was checked.** `node scripts/check-file-tree.mjs`; `git merge-base v4-build origin/main` gives `550ff8f`.

## Entry 0.3 - 2026-10-22 - `v4implementation.md` revised for caption quality and the editor's design (outside a prompt)

**Why.** The founder's brief of 2026-10-22 sets V4's bar higher: better captions, a better final video and a better user experience than Submagic, for content creators in general (not only technical creators), with a clean, premium and user-friendly interface.

**What changed in the plan.**
- **Header.** A quality-bar section maps every line of the founder's two lists (A: caption intelligence; B: editor experience) to the decision that answers it.
- **Two new decision groups.**
  - Section 2.9, caption intelligence (D-167 to D-176):
    - phrase-aware line breaks by a least-cost search (no article or preposition stranded, balanced lines)
    - a 700 ms reading floor taken from silence only
    - three emphasis layers (spoken word, stressed word, numbers)
    - a redesigned premium default (Clean: Inter 800, soft shadow, the spoken word on a sliding highlight pill)
    - draggable caption placement with snap points, the visuals following
    - preview-export parity tests
    - edit to preview within 150 ms (shaping cache, redraw while paused)
    - hit testing
    - "Change all N" for repeated mis-hearings
    - honest scope for suggestions
  - Section 2.10, editor experience and design (D-177 to D-193):
    - the audience and plain-word copy
    - the editor layout: top bar, preview, four tabs
    - a dark design system in tokens, Inter as the interface font, primitives and icons
    - the transcript editor; direct manipulation on the preview
    - undo, redo and visible autosave; keyboard shortcuts
    - style cards rendered from the clip itself; the Visuals and Framing tabs
    - processing, export and error experiences
    - two founder design reviews on captured screens; accessibility (axe); interface performance
- **Section 17** is replaced by a full interface and interaction specification: principles, screens and states, components, interaction details, copy, styles.
- **Updated to match:**
  - scope (1.1, 1.2); the file tree (new scene files, the editor's layout, primitives and use-cases, the font, `history.ts`)
  - the build order: 19 steps over 13 days, with S8 caption intelligence, S10 design system and shell, S10A design review 1, S19 design review 2
  - the protocol (`hitTest`, `styleThumbnails`); the use-cases and stores
  - tests (`line_breaks.rs` written before the algorithm, `placement.rs`, `parity.rs`, `scene_cache.rs`, `hit.rs`, `history.test.ts`, the editor cases and axe in `review-edit.spec.ts`)
  - the measurements (edit to preview, thumbnails, hit test, shell budget with the font)
  - the hand-over table, the exit checklist (both design reviews, the line-break reading), the spec issues (16-22) and the constants
- **D-139, D-142, D-146, D-154 and D-159** point to their successors. Decisions now run D-113 to D-193.

**New reopened contracts.**
- `EditState` gains `caption_position` and `highlight_numbers`, with serde defaults so V3's records still read (D-169, D-171).
- `ReviewActionKind` in the analytics allowlist gains five members, so the server is rebuilt (section 13).
- `FontSet` gains key 4 (Inter 800), appended (D-170).

**For the founder.**
- At S8, read ten rows of the line-break table.
- At S10A and S19, review the captured screens.
- Copy-back item 16: the product spec's target customer becomes content creators in general (applied at S18).

**How it was checked.** `node scripts/check-file-tree.mjs` passes. Decision numbers run D-113 to D-193 with no gap. No code changed.

## Entry 0.4 - 2026-10-22 - `v4buildguide.md` written (outside a prompt)

**What.** `docs/v4/v4buildguide.md`, the step-by-step guide for V4, in the structure of `v3buildguide.md`:
- what it is, how to read the references, how it is organised, a phase overview, and "Read this first" (ten traps)
- **20 phases (0-19) over 13 days.** Each phase has a goal, numbered steps with Order / File / Section / Watch-for tables, commands with their expected output, a "Prove the guards" step where a guard is new, and a milestone ending in `Pass:`, a commit on `v4-build`, a push and a CI read on PR #7.
- **Three human gates:**
  - Step 8.2: the founder reads ten rows of the line-break table, before the algorithm exists.
  - Phase 11: design review 1, on sixteen captured screens.
  - Step 19.5: design review 2 on the deployed editor, plus five goldens.
- a quick reference, and the assumptions and gaps found

TS §5 already lists the file.

**Found while writing it, and applied to `v4implementation.md` in the same commit.**
- **The interface font.** `vercel.json` rewrites every path outside `/api/`, `/assets/` and `/ort/` to `index.html`, so the font moves from `web/public/fonts/` to `web/src/ui/assets/` (a hashed `/assets/` file; D-180, §3.2, §4, §17.6).
- **The screen capture** gets its own Playwright project, `screens`, and a root script `pnpm screens`. CI never runs it (§4, §19.2).
- **Goldens.** S7 writes only the two video-only goldens; the other fourteen are written at S9, because the look changes Clean (§5).

**Other placements.** The guide's "Assumptions (c)" lists them:
- `v3_reference.rs` is rewritten in Phase 5 and passes in Phase 6.
- A minimal `review-update.ts` is written in Phase 12 and completed in Phase 13.
- The new copy keys are written in Phase 10, so the design review reads real words.

**How it was checked.** `node scripts/check-file-tree.mjs` passes. Every phase maps to an S-step of §5. The counts used (461/0/3, 92, 12, 48 media cases) are V3's close. No code changed.
